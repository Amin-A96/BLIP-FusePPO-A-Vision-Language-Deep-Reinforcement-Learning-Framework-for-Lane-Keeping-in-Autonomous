# Vision-Language-Model-Guided-Lane-Keeping-using-PPO-with-PID-Based-State-Augmentation
# Overviews
Autonomous lane-keeping remains challenging in dynamic environments. This work proposes BLIP-FusePPO, a novel reinforcement learning framework that integrates semantic perception via a Vision-Language Model (BLIP) with PID-based control feedback directly into the agent’s observation space. This multimodal fusion improves robustness, generalization, and lane-keeping precision, outperforming prior methods like DDPG and VL-SAFE.
